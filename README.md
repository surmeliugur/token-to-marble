Token to Marble

Token to Marble is an experimental research pipeline that transforms raw language tokens into structured semantic entities called Marbles.

Unlike traditional NLP pipelines that treat tokens as flat, discrete symbols, this project explores a field-based representation where each linguistic unit acquires position, mass, and interaction potential derived from real corpus statistics and embedding spaces.

This repository focuses on construction, not claims.

What is a Marble?

A token is a symbol.

A Marble is a semantic particle with properties:

Position
Derived from vector embeddings (e.g. FastText, Word2Vec).
Represents where a concept resides in semantic space.

Mass / Density
Derived from corpus statistics (frequency, distribution).
Represents semantic “gravitational pull”.

Interactions
Attraction, repulsion, and resonance between Marbles, computed from
semantic proximity and calibrated constraints.

A Marble is not a metaphor.
It is a data structure with physical-like constraints.

What This Repository Does

Current pipeline stages:

Corpus Processing

Large-scale Turkish corpora

Streaming token extraction

Frequency and distribution analysis

Token Universe Construction

Unique token space

Frequency-ranked vocabulary

Candidate selection for Marble generation

Marble Generation (Experimental)

Token → Marble transformation

Assignment of mass, volume, density

Initial interaction fields

Semantic & Ethical Field Mapping (Research Phase)

Field alignment experiments

Controlled calibration of semantic polarity

Early topography mapping

Why “Token to Marble”?

Most NLP systems stop at representation.

This project asks a different question:

What if linguistic meaning is not just represented,
but behaves?

Token → Marble is an attempt to move from:

discrete symbols
to

interacting semantic entities

This is not a replacement for embeddings.
It is a layer built on top of them.

Scope and Limitations

This is not a finished model.

This is not a production system.

This is not a claim of new physics.

It is:

an exploratory research codebase

a reproducible pipeline

a controlled environment for semantic experiments

All results should be treated as experimental.

Language and Data

Primary language: Turkish

Corpus-driven (news, articles, real usage)

Embeddings are external and replaceable

The framework itself is language-agnostic.

Status

Version: v0.1 (experimental)

Token extraction: Complete

Frequency universe: Complete

Marble candidates: in progress

Field calibration: rsearch phase

Philosophy (Minimal)

Meaning is not static.
It has structure, weight, and interaction.

This repository is an attempt to model that — carefully.
